<h2>About me...</h2>

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a student at 42 Porto, where I'm developing my skills in programming with a focus on C language. Alongside my studies, I have also taken courses in SQL, databases, and C# programming.

As a curious and motivated learner, I have pursued additional training in Python and web development, including HTML and CSS. My passion for technology and my determination to improve my skills have enabled me to approach every project with enthusiasm and a drive to succeed.

I am committed to continuous growth and improvement, and I take pride in my ability to adapt to new challenges and technologies. With a positive and proactive attitude, I am always eager to take on new opportunities and collaborate with others to achieve our shared goals.

In short, I am a dedicated and ambitious student with a passion for programming and a thirst for knowledge. I am excited to continue my journey as a developer and to contribute to the vibrant and supportive community here on GitHub.
